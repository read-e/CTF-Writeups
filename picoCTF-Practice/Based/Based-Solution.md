**Instructions:** To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 29956.

For a challenge named `based`, this one wasn't very. Open three tabs that use cyberchef, and paste each string in to convert them. It starts as binary with a space delimiter, then octal with a space delimiter, then hex with no delimiter.
