# useless
Liam Reidy

**Instructions:** There's an interesting script in the user's home directory The work computer is running SSH. We've been given a script which performs some basic calculations, explore the script and find a flag.

This challenge was quite literally useless.

1. ssh with the given credentials
2. use `cat` to view the contents of the executable
3. see at the end of the file it says to consult the manual
4. `man useless` and the flag is listed at the bottom
