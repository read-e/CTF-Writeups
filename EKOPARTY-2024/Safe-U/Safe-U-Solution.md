This challenge started by directing us to a twitter account where a screenshot of a sftp login was posted.

On the same twitter account, this user posted their password entered into the password strength checker website, telling us it was
1. easily guessable
2. **8 characters long**

An even earlier tweet had the user's birthday

```
Acabo de darme cuenta que ya pasaron 201 dÃ­as de mi Ãºltimo cumpleaÃ±os... 
solo faltan 165 para mis 30 Â¡A disfrutar lo que restan de mis 29!ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
```

With some simple translation and math, we find that the user's birthday is `March 22nd 1995`. As 8 characters, that could be written as `22031995`, and sure enough that is the stfp server's password.

In the server, there was a zip file in a hidden directory.

```
Connected to 200.58.100.246.
sftp> ls
sftp> ls -a
.         ..        .privado
sftp> cd .privado
sftp> ls
flag.zip
```

The zip was password protected, so I brute forced the hash with `zip2john` and `john`.

```
zip2john Downloads/flag.zip > hash.txt

john hash.txt

As seen above, `november` is the password to the zip, and the zip contains the file `rockyou.jpg`, which displays the flag:

It was actually quite surprising that the flag was just the name of the challenge...
