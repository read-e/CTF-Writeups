We are given an image of a newspaper:

![newspaper image](./PETRUS%20roeit%20Indonesische%20misdaad%20uit.png "Title")

\
Putting the title in Google translate shows me that it is in Dutch. I Googled "dutch newspaper archive and found this site: https://www.kb.nl/en/research-find/datasets/delpher-newspapers

Searching the dataset by the title of the newspaper returned it as the first result. I put the date in the flag, and that was all.
